# Net-Shortst-Path-Visualization https://matestampa.github.io/Shortest-Path-NetVisualization/
Hi everyone! As the name says, it's a shortest path visualization tool/game using Graphs. However, it isn't made as the usual grid shape. I wanted something different
from the overussed repositories and youtube videos about this topic. This one is in shape of Net, and you can create infinite random Graphs with different numbers of nodes
and connections.

After that, you can select your start and end point; and visualize the shortest-path with the oportunity of seing how the different algorithms work. Also you can delete
edges and see how the path change.

This project has been hard-working for me, and I'm satisfied with the result (except the frontend which never was the focus jaja) and what I've learnt.

I hope you enjoy it, and I would be glad to hear your comments.
